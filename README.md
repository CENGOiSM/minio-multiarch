Provides nightly builds of Minio server Docker images compatible with `arm64`,
`armhf`/`armv7`, and `amd64` architectures.

### Minio Server

[Minio][minio-home] is an OSS project offering a "high performance distributed
object storage server", with fabulous features like an S3-compliant API,
excellent documentation, and other great features out-of-the-box:

- Regularly updated Docker images â€” although the upstream provides builds for
  AMD64 only, unfortunately.

- An officially supported (in-tree) [Helm chart][minio-helm] for easy Kubernetes
  deployment.

* A pretty dope CLI client, [mc][mc-github], for interfacing with not just Minio
  but any S3-compliant API. I've got a [multi-arch image][mc-link] for that too!

However, there's currently no officially maintained Docker image compatible with
architectures other than amd64. And while they provide cross-compiled binaries
for ARM/ARM64, these releases often lag months behind the Darwin or Linux
AMD64 binaries.

This repo triggers a nightly job on CircleCI to build Docker images for all
three architectures, then updates the repository manifest accordingly. Just
`docker run --rm -it jessestuart/minio` on any platform, and you'll be on your
way to storage success.

### How can I use this?

You can run the following command to stand up a standalone instance of Minio
Server on Docker: (replace `/export/minio`)

```bash
docker run \
  -v /export/minio \
  -v /export/minio-config:/root/.minio \
  -p 9000:9000 \
  jessestuart/minio server /export
```

### Kubernetes

This image can also be used to deploy a Minio pod to a Kubernetes cluster. See
the [official docs][minio-k8s] on deploying Minio to Kubernetes for more detail,
or check out the Minio [Helm chart][minio-helm] documentation.
